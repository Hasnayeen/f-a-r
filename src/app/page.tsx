          And it piqued my curiosity as the post was to the point and no BS, I
          liked that. So I checked out your profile and your product
          &quot;Breeew&quot; (Interesting name by the way) and liked what your
          doing with it. I have a feeling you&apos;re the kind of person
          I&apos;ll enjoy working with. So I decided to build this personalized
          website in few hours in a stack I&apos;m not familiar with for your
          kind consideration.

          I&apos;m Nehal Hasnayeen, a developer from Bangladesh. I&apos;ve been
          working as a developer for last 9 years in different settings. While
          PHP/Laravel is my primary stack but I like to learn new stuff, build
          things and experiment with intresting ideas. I started learning React
          last week and today built this site with nextjs without any prior
          experience, but learning is always fun, well most of the time.

          I was at a crossroads in my final year at university. I was studying
          Chemical Engineering and I wasn&apos;t enjoying it at all and I was
          severely depressed. I had enough. I had to take a decision, either
          finish my degree no matter how long it takes and be miserable or look
          for an alternative. One day at a random shop I saw a DVD (remember
          those things) with a catchy title, earn money with something called
          Joomla. So I decided to check it out and started learning, so my dev
          journey began. Then I started learning HTML, CSS and web development
          in general and finally decided to drop out of university and moved to
          the capital to become a professional developer.

          I enrolled in a course and learned PHP that lead to my first job where
          I stared working on, wait for it, &quot;Java&quot;. Worked on some ERP
          for two month and was moved to a different team to work on, again wait
          for it, &quot;Python&quot;. After a month I decided to quit and focus
          on PHP + Laravel through self learing. Few months later joined a
          software team in a major corporation where I got the opportunity to
          work with and learn from some talented folks. But the corporate
          environment didn&apos;t suit me so after one and half year I decided
          to move on and worked only in remote jobs ever since.

          While I try to follow the general industry standard best practices in
          my work but I don&apos;t mind unconventional approach and non standard
          solution, because at the end of the day, I care more about solving
          real-world problems than wasting time with silly technical dogma.
          That&apos;s why I learn new stuff to broaden my perspective. I&apos;ve
          tried elixir and rust and learing front end stuff more seriously just
          recently.

        I built a product once couple of years back, while it didn&apos;t went
        as I intended but it made tiny profit and taught me a very costly
        lesson. I won&apos;t bore you with the lesson but if you&apos;re curious
        let me know.

          I&apos;m looking to work on a project where I won&apos;t be a code
          monkey, just ticking off some task list. I want to take ownership of
          the work, have valued input, have a impact on the business. While I
          don&apos;t know what kind of tech skill you&apos;re looking for but
          one thing I can asure you is honesty. I don&apos;t BS you, if I
          don&apos;t know then I&apos;ll tell so, if I failed then I failed. You
          won&apos;t have to guess.
